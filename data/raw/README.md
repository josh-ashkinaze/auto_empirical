The `countypres_2000-2020.csv` file was downloaded from this url (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
on 2024-10-15. The file is `countypres_2000-2020.tab` and we used the option to download as CSV.

The `PopulationEstimates.xlsx` comes from this url (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/county-level-data-sets-download-data/) downloaded on 
2024-10-15. The link clicked was `Population estimates for the United States, States, and counties, 2020â€“23` and it was last updated `6/20/2024` at the time of download. Then I extracted
the first sheet to a CSV file, yielding `PopulationEstimates.csv`.
